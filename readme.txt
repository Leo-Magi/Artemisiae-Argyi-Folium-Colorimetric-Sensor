This unzipped package holds the code and models for the relevant functions as follows:

"Aiye_GUI.py": achieves the software interface in the GUI packaged with the Multilayer Perceptron model.
"Extarct_RGB.py": realizes circle detection and RGB value extraction of preprocessed images.
"MLP_trained.py": implements the training of the Multilayer Perceptron model.
"RF_trained.py": implements the training of the Random Forest model.
"Standard_preprocessing.py": implements preprocessing related to uploaded images.
"best_model2.pth": model after Multilayer Perceptron training. (The model is too large to upload. If needed, please contact me personally for a private transfer.)
